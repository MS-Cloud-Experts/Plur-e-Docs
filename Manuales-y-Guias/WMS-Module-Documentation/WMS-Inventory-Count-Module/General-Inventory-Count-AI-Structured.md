# GENERAL INVENTORY COUNT TRAINING DOCUMENT

## CONTEXT
This document provides structured information about general inventory count procedures for training an AI chatbot. The chatbot should be able to assist users with inventory counting processes using the Plur-E application.

## DEFINITIONS AND KEY CONCEPTS

### General Inventory Count
- Definition: Process of counting physical inventory items without pre-loading them in a batch
- Use Case: Companies without advanced warehouse management systems
- Primary Tool: Plur-E application
- Integration: Connects with Business Central

### Plur-E Application
- Definition: Mobile application for inventory management
- Primary Function: Facilitates physical inventory counting
- Key Feature: Real-time synchronization with Business Central

## PROCESS WORKFLOWS

### Initial Access Flow
```yaml
steps:
  1: Launch Plur-E application
  2: Select company
  3: Access Inventory Cycle Count module
  valid_responses:
  - "Open the Plur-E app"
  - "How do I start the inventory count?"
  - "Where do I find the inventory module?"
```

### Location Setup Flow
```yaml
steps:
  1: Verify location selection
  2: Choose General Inventory Count
  3: Select Physical Inventory
context:
  note: "Default location is configured in Plur-E Web user preferences"
common_questions:
  - "How do I change my location?"
  - "Where do I find the location settings?"
  - "What if my location is wrong?"
```

### Batch Management Flow
```yaml
steps:
  1: Select inventory batch
  2: Confirm batch selection
important_notes:
  - Business Central data will be overwritten by Plur-E
  - Batch selection cannot be changed during counting
common_issues:
  - "Batch not showing"
  - "Cannot select batch"
  - "Batch synchronization errors"
```

### Counting Process Flow
```yaml
steps:
  1: Access scanning interface
  2: Scan product label
  3: Enter physical quantity
  4: Verify entry
scenarios:
  less_than_calculated:
    condition: "Physical < Calculated"
    action: "Generate negative adjustment"
    system_response: "Creates negative adjustment line"
  zero_or_new:
    condition: "New item or zero quantity"
    action: "Generate positive adjustment"
    system_response: "Creates new inventory line"
  more_than_calculated:
    condition: "Physical > Calculated"
    action: "Generate positive adjustment"
    system_response: "Creates positive adjustment line"
```

### Completion Workflow
```yaml
steps:
  1: Select Finish option
  2: Wait for sync confirmation
  3: Verify in Business Central
  4: Post journal
validation_points:
  - Sync status
  - Line creation
  - Quantity accuracy
```

## ERROR HANDLING

### Common Errors
```yaml
scanning_errors:
  - issue: "Invalid barcode scan"
    response: "Please ensure the barcode is clear and try scanning again"
  - issue: "Product not found"
    response: "Verify the product exists in the system or contact support"
  
sync_errors:
  - issue: "Failed to sync with Business Central"
    response: "Check your connection and try again. If persists, contact IT support"
  - issue: "Batch sync error"
    response: "Ensure all entries are complete and try syncing again"
```

## BEST PRACTICES

### User Guidelines
```yaml
recommendations:
  - Always verify company selection before starting
  - Ensure correct location is selected
  - Verify synced data before posting
  - Document any discrepancies
  - Regular sync status checks
  - Review adjustments before posting
```

## CONVERSATIONAL EXAMPLES

### User Interactions
```yaml
example_1:
  user: "How do I start counting inventory?"
  bot_response: "I'll help you start the inventory count. First, open the Plur-E application and verify you've selected the correct company. Would you like me to guide you through the next steps?"

example_2:
  user: "What happens if I find more items than expected?"
  bot_response: "If you find more items than the calculated quantity, the system will automatically generate a positive adjustment in the Physical Inventory Journal. Would you like me to explain how this adjustment works?"

example_3:
  user: "I can't find my batch"
  bot_response: "Let's troubleshoot this together. First, make sure you're in the correct company and location. Have you verified these settings?"
```

## TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### Common Issues
```yaml
connectivity:
  issue: "App not connecting"
  steps:

    - Confirm user credentials
    - Restart application if needed

data_sync:
  issue: "Sync not working"
  steps:
    - Check connection status
