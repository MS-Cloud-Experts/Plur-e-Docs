### API Documentation: RemoveLPFromWarehousePick

#### **Overview**
The method `RemoveLPFromWarehousePick` is used to remove a specific License Plate (LP) from a **Warehouse Pick** process. This method ensures that the specified LP is disassociated from the pick, and the quantities that were previously fulfilled by the LP are restored to the pick lines, allowing the pick to be fulfilled by other LPs or processes.

#### **Request Structure**
```json
{
  "ProcessMethod": "RemoveLPFromWarehousePick",
  "Parameters": [
    {
      "WarehousePickNo": "WHSE PICK-03610",
      "LPDocumentNo": "LP-00023"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### **Parameters**
- **ProcessMethod**: The method to invoke, in this case `"RemoveLPFromWarehousePick"`.
- **Parameters**: An array of objects describing the necessary parameters for removing the LP from the warehouse pick.
  - **WarehousePickNo**: The unique identifier for the warehouse pick from which the LP is to be removed (e.g., `"WHSE PICK-03610"`).
  - **LPDocumentNo**: The License Plate (LP) document number to be removed from the pick (e.g., `"LP-00023"`).

#### **Process Flow**
1. **Parameter Parsing**:
   - The method validates and extracts the `WarehousePickNo` and `LPDocumentNo` from the JSON input to ensure they are valid.
   
2. **LP Removal**:
   - The system checks if the specified LP is currently assigned to the given pick.
   - If the LP is assigned, it is disassociated from the pick, and the quantities fulfilled by the LP are returned to the pick lines.
   
3. **Update of Quantities**:
   - The quantities that were previously fulfilled by the LP are updated, ensuring the pick can be fulfilled by other LPs or left open for further fulfillment.

4. **Output Generation**:
   - The method outputs a JSON response indicating whether the LP was successfully removed and the updated status of the pick.

#### **Example Request**
```json
{
  "ProcessMethod": "RemoveLPFromWarehousePick",
  "Parameters": [
    {
      "WarehousePickNo": "WHSE PICK-03610",
      "LPDocumentNo": "LP-00023"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### **Example Response**
```json
{
  "RemovedLP": {
    "PickNo": "WHSE PICK-03610",
    "LP": "LP-00023",
    "Status": "Removed",
    "RestoredQty": 5.0
  },
  "Message": "LP successfully removed from Warehouse Pick."
}
```

#### **Response Fields**
- **RemovedLP**: An object containing details of the removed LP:
  - **PickNo**: The number of the warehouse pick (e.g., `"WHSE PICK-03610"`).
  - **LP**: The License Plate (LP) number that was removed from the pick (e.g., `"LP-00023"`).
  - **Status**: The status of the LP after removal (e.g., `"Removed"`).
  - **RestoredQty**: The quantity that was restored to the pick lines as a result of removing the LP (e.g., `5.0`).
  
- **Message**: A message indicating the success or failure of the LP removal operation.

#### **LP Removal Process**
The LP removal process follows these steps:
1. **Validation**: Ensure that the specified LP is currently assigned to the given pick.
2. **Disassociation**: If valid, the LP is disassociated from the pick, and the quantities fulfilled by the LP are returned to the pick lines.
3. **Update Quantities**: After the LP is removed, the system updates the pick lines to reflect the restored quantities, making them available for fulfillment by other LPs or processes.
4. **Status Update**: The LP's status is updated to indicate that it is no longer assigned to the pick.

#### **Considerations**
- **Error Handling**: If the LP is not found or is not assigned to the specified pick, the method should return an appropriate error message indicating the issue.
- **Quantity Restoration**: Once the LP is removed, the quantities must be accurately restored to the pick lines to ensure the pick can be fulfilled by other LPs.

#### **Summary**
The `RemoveLPFromWarehousePick` method provides a simple and efficient way to remove License Plates (LPs) from a warehouse pick, ensuring that the pick lines are properly updated and that the quantities fulfilled by the LP are restored for further processing. This method is crucial for handling scenarios where an LP needs to be disassociated from a pick, either due to incorrect assignment or changes in fulfillment strategy.
