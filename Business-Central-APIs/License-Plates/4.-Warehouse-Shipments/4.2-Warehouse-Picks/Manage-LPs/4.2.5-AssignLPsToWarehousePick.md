### API Documentation: AssignLPsToWarehousePick

#### **Overview**
The method `AssignLPsToWarehousePick` is used to assign one or more License Plates (LPs) to a **Warehouse Pick** process. It evaluates the given LPs to ensure they fulfill the requested quantities for each pick line. The method allows multiple LPs to fulfill a single pick if necessary and ensures that the LPs match the exact quantities without extra or missing items. If the total quantity across all assigned LPs satisfies the pick, the LPs will be assigned and the warehouse pick updated. Otherwise, the method returns information about the items that could not be fulfilled.

#### **Request Structure**
```json
{
  "ProcessMethod": "AssignLPsToWarehousePick",
  "Parameters": [
    {
      "WarehousePickNo": "WHSE PICK-03610",
      "LPDocumentNos": [
        "LP-00023",
        "LP-00024",
        "LP-00025"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### **Parameters**
- **ProcessMethod**: The method to invoke, in this case `"AssignLPsToWarehousePick"`.
- **Parameters**: An array of objects describing the necessary parameters for assigning LPs to the warehouse pick.
  - **WarehousePickNo**: The unique identifier for the warehouse pick to which the LPs will be assigned (e.g., `"WHSE PICK-03610"`).
  - **LPDocumentNos**: An array of LP document numbers that are being evaluated for assignment (e.g., `["LP-00023", "LP-00024", "LP-00025"]`).

#### **Process Flow**
1. **Parameter Parsing**:
   - The method validates and extracts the `WarehousePickNo` and the list of `LPDocumentNos` to be assigned.
   
2. **LP Validation**:
   - The system checks each LP to ensure it can be assigned to the warehouse pick, ensuring that the quantities in each LP match the quantities requested by the pick lines.
   - The system verifies if multiple LPs are needed to satisfy a single pick line.
   
3. **Assignment Process**:
   - The LPs are assigned to the pick lines. As each LP is assigned, the remaining quantities needed for the pick are updated dynamically.
   - If the total quantity across the LPs satisfies the pick, the LPs are marked as assigned, and their status is updated accordingly.
   
4. **Output Generation**:
   - The method outputs a JSON response indicating which LPs were successfully assigned and which pick lines were not fully satisfied.

#### **Example Request**
```json
{
  "ProcessMethod": "AssignLPsToWarehousePick",
  "Parameters": [
    {
      "WarehousePickNo": "WHSE PICK-03610",
      "LPDocumentNos": [
        "LP-00023",
        "LP-00024",
        "LP-00025"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### **Example Response**
```json
{
  "LPAssignmentResults": [
    {
      "LP": "LP-00148",
      "Assigned": true
    },
    {
      "PickNo": "WHSE PICK-02866",
      "FullyAssigned": true,
      "AssignedItems": [
        {
          "ItemNo": "D0BDBD",
          "VariantCode": "B60W225",
          "AssignedQty": 60.0
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### **Response Fields**
- **AssignedLPs**: An array containing details of the LPs that were successfully assigned to the warehouse pick:
  - **PickNo**: The number of the warehouse pick (e.g., `"WHSE PICK-03610"`).
  - **LP**: The License Plate number assigned to the pick line (e.g., `"LP-00023"`).
  - **ItemNo**: The item number assigned (e.g., `"ITEM123"`).
  - **QtyAssigned**: The quantity assigned from the LP to the pick line (e.g., `2.0`).
  - **QtyRemaining**: The remaining quantity required for the pick line (e.g., `0.0` if fully satisfied).
  
- **UnfulfilledLines**: An array of pick lines that could not be fully satisfied:
  - **PickNo**: The warehouse pick number (e.g., `"WHSE PICK-03610"`).
  - **ItemNo**: The item number for the unfulfilled pick line (e.g., `"ITEM789"`).
  - **QtyRequested**: The original quantity requested for the pick line (e.g., `5.0`).
  - **QtyUnfulfilled**: The quantity that could not be fulfilled by the provided LPs (e.g., `2.0`).

- **Message**: A message indicating whether all lines were fulfilled or if additional LPs are needed to satisfy the pick.

#### **LP Assignment Process**
The LP assignment process follows these steps:
1. **Exact Quantities**: LPs must match the exact quantity required by the pick line without exceeding or missing items.
2. **Multiple LPs**: If a single LP cannot satisfy the quantity, the system combines multiple LPs until the pick line's quantity is fulfilled.
3. **Dynamic Quantity Reduction**: As each LP is assigned, the remaining quantity for the pick line is reduced, ensuring that subsequent LPs only fulfill the remaining amount.
4. **Status Update**: Once an LP is assigned, its status is updated to reflect that it has been picked.

#### **Considerations**
- **Splitting**: The method ensures that if multiple LPs are required, they can be combined to fulfill the total quantity requested.
- **Error Handling**: If no LPs can fulfill the pick line, or if there are discrepancies in quantities, the system returns the unfulfilled lines.
- **Scalability**: The method is designed to handle large warehouse picks with multiple LPs efficiently.

#### **Summary**
The `AssignLPsToWarehousePick` method provides a robust solution for assigning multiple License Plates (LPs) to a warehouse pick, ensuring that all requested quantities are fulfilled without extra or missing items. The method dynamically adjusts the quantities as LPs are assigned and returns detailed information about successful assignments and any remaining unfulfilled lines. This ensures efficient warehouse operations and minimizes errors in the picking process.
