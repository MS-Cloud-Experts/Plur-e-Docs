### API Documentation: SplitLP

#### Overview
The `SplitLP` API method enables the splitting of an existing License Plate (LP) into multiple new LPs based on specified quantities for each line within the original LP. This process includes validation, creation of new LPs, and registration of movements, ensuring accurate tracking and inventory management.

#### Request Structure
```json
{
  "ProcessMethod": "SplitLP",
  "Parameters": [
    {
      "LPDocumentNo": "LP001",
      "LinesToSplit": [
        {
          "LPLineNo": 1000,
          "QuantityToSplit": 60
        },
        {
          "LPLineNo": 2000,
          "QuantityToSplit": 40
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Parameters
- **LPDocumentNo**: The document number of the License Plate (LP) to be split (e.g., `"LP001"`).
- **LinesToSplit**: An array of objects specifying the lines within the LP that need to be split. Each object should contain:
  - **LPLineNo**: The line number within the LP that is being split (e.g., `1000`).
  - **QuantityToSplit**: The quantity from the line that should be split into a new LP (e.g., `60`).

#### Example Request
```json
{
  "ProcessMethod": "SplitLP",
  "Parameters": [
    {
      "LPDocumentNo": "LP001",
      "LinesToSplit": [
        {
          "LPLineNo": 1000,
          "QuantityToSplit": 60
        },
        {
          "LPLineNo": 2000,
          "QuantityToSplit": 40
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Example Response
```json
{
  "OriginalLP": "LP001",
  "NewLPs": [
    {
      "LPDocumentNo": "LP002"
    },
    {
      "LPDocumentNo": "LP003"
    }
  ],
  "Message": "The LP has been successfully split."
}
```

#### Explanation
- **OriginalLP**: The document number of the original License Plate that was split.
- **NewLPs**: An array of objects representing the newly created License Plates. Each object contains:
  - **LPDocumentNo**: The document number of the new LP.
- **Message**: A confirmation message indicating the successful completion of the split.

#### Summary
The `SplitLP` method simplifies the process of dividing an existing LP into multiple new LPs based on user-specified quantities. It ensures that any remaining quantities stay in the original LP unless fully allocated to new LPs, which would result in the deletion of the original LP. Each new LP and its corresponding movements are accurately recorded, providing transparency and traceability throughout the inventory management process.

This method is vital for efficient warehouse operations, enabling precise control over inventory distribution across different LPs, bins, and locations while maintaining a clear audit trail.
