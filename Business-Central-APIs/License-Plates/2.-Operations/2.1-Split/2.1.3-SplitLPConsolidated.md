Gracias por la aclaración. Si la API ahora devuelve un único nuevo LP consolidado en lugar de múltiples LPs, ajustaré la documentación de acuerdo a ese comportamiento.

### API Documentation: SplitLPConsolidated

#### Overview
The `SplitLPConsolidated` API method allows for the splitting of specific lines from an existing License Plate (LP) into a single new consolidated LP. This process ensures that the resulting LP reflects the correct quantities for each split line, consolidating all the requested changes into one new LP.

#### Request Structure
```json
{
  "ProcessMethod": "SplitLPConsolidated",
  "Parameters": [
    {
      "LPDocumentNo": "LP-00042",
      "LinesToSplit": [
        {
          "LPLineNo": 10000,
          "QuantityToSplit": 1
        },
        {
          "LPLineNo": 20000,
          "QuantityToSplit": 1
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Parameters
- **LPDocumentNo**: The document number of the License Plate (LP) to be split (e.g., `"LP001"`).
- **LinesToSplit**: An array of objects specifying the lines within the LP that need to be split. Each object should contain:
  - **LPLineNo**: The line number within the LP that is being split (e.g., `1000`).
  - **QuantityToSplit**: The quantity from the line that should be split into the new consolidated LP (e.g., `60`).

#### Example Request
```json
{
  "ProcessMethod": "SplitLPConsolidated",
  "Parameters": [
    {
      "LPDocumentNo": "LP001",
      "LinesToSplit": [
        {
          "LPLineNo": 1000,
          "QuantityToSplit": 60
        },
        {
          "LPLineNo": 2000,
          "QuantityToSplit": 40
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Example Response
```json
{
  "OriginalLP": "LP001",
  "NewLP": {
    "LPDocumentNo": "LP002"
  },
  "Message": "The LP has been successfully split into a new consolidated LP."
}
```

#### Explanation
- **OriginalLP**: The document number of the original License Plate that was split.
- **NewLP**: The document number of the newly created consolidated License Plate (e.g., `"LP002"`).
- **Message**: A confirmation message indicating the successful completion of the split into one new LP.

#### Summary
The `SplitLPConsolidated` method enables the splitting of lines from an existing LP and consolidating them into a single new LP. The API ensures that the specified quantities from the original LP are correctly reflected in the new consolidated LP, reducing complexity and maintaining accuracy in inventory records.

This method is crucial for scenarios where a simplified, single LP result is desired, rather than generating multiple LPs for each split. It provides clarity in inventory management, ensuring efficient tracking and management of warehouse operations.
