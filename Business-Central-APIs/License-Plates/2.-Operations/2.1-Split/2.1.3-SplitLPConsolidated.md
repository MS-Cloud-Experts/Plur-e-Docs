### API Documentation: SplitLPConsolidated

#### Overview
The `SplitLPConsolidated` API method facilitates the splitting of lines from an existing License Plate (LP) into a set of new LPs based on specified quantities for each line. This operation consolidates the process by allowing multiple lines to be split in a single request, ensuring that the resulting new LPs are accurately created and recorded within the system for inventory management purposes.

#### Request Structure
```json
{
  "ProcessMethod": "SplitLPConsolidated",
  "Parameters": [
    {
      "LPDocumentNo": "LP001",
      "LinesToSplit": [
        {
          "LPLineNo": 1000,
          "QuantityToSplit": 60
        },
        {
          "LPLineNo": 2000,
          "QuantityToSplit": 40
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Parameters
- **LPDocumentNo**: The document number of the License Plate (LP) to be split (e.g., `"LP001"`).
- **LinesToSplit**: An array of objects specifying the lines within the LP that need to be split. Each object should contain:
  - **LPLineNo**: The line number within the LP that is being split (e.g., `1000`).
  - **QuantityToSplit**: The quantity from the line that should be split into new LPs (e.g., `60`).

#### Example Request
```json
{
  "ProcessMethod": "SplitLPConsolidated",
  "Parameters": [
    {
      "LPDocumentNo": "LP001",
      "LinesToSplit": [
        {
          "LPLineNo": 1000,
          "QuantityToSplit": 60
        },
        {
          "LPLineNo": 2000,
          "QuantityToSplit": 40
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Example Response
```json
{
  "OriginalLP": "LP001",
  "NewLPs": [
    {
      "LPDocumentNo": "LP002"
    },
    {
      "LPDocumentNo": "LP003"
    }
  ],
  "Message": "The lines in the LP have been successfully split."
}
```

#### Explanation
- **OriginalLP**: The document number of the original License Plate that was split.
- **NewLPs**: An array of objects representing the newly created License Plates. Each object contains:
  - **LPDocumentNo**: The document number of the new LP.
- **Message**: A confirmation message indicating the successful completion of the split.

#### Summary
The `SplitLPConsolidated` method allows for the efficient splitting of multiple lines from an LP into new LPs in a single consolidated process. The method ensures that the quantities from each line are correctly allocated into new LPs, simplifying the inventory management process while maintaining accurate records of movements and adjustments. This streamlined approach improves warehouse operations by reducing the complexity of creating individual LPs for each split and provides a clear audit trail for future reference.

This method is particularly useful in environments where frequent splitting of LPs is necessary, optimizing inventory control, and ensuring efficient distribution across different warehouse locations or bins.
