}
```

#### Response Fields
- **TotalQty**: The total quantity of the item available in the bin.
- **TotalQtyInLP**: The total quantity of the item calculated from the License Plates in the bin.
- **Details**: An array containing details of each License Plate (LP) in the bin.
  - **LP**: The License Plate identifier.
  - **Qty**: The quantity of the item associated with the LP.

#### Explanation
- **TotalQty**: The cumulative quantity of the specified item in the bin.
- **TotalQtyInLP**: The total quantity calculated from the LPs containing the item in the bin.
- **Details**: A breakdown of each License Plate (LP) storing the item and the quantity in each LP.

#### Process Flow
1. **Parse Input**: The API takes in `LocationCode`, `BinCode`, `ItemNo`, and `UnitofMeasureCode` as input parameters.
2. **Fetch Bin Content**: It retrieves movements of the specified item within the location and bin, filtered by the item number and unit of measure.
3. **Calculate Quantities**: It calculates the total quantity of the item in the bin and breaks down quantities by each LP.
4. **Return Response**: The API responds with the total quantities and a detailed list of LPs and their associated quantities.

#### Example Use Case
If a warehouse manager wants to know the contents of bin "STO1" in location "CCC" for item "1900-S" (measured in PCS), this API will return the total quantity of the item and a detailed list of License Plates (LPs) in that bin, along with how much of the item is stored in each LP.

#### Summary
The `GetBinContentByItemLocation` API is an essential tool for warehouse operations, providing detailed information about the contents of a specific bin for a particular item. It ensures that all License Plates storing the item are accurately accounted for, facilitating efficient warehouse management and stock control.
